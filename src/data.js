        postCaption: "The range was formerly a remote unknown area. It was named 'Schweizerland' in 1912 by Swiss geophysicist and Arctic explorer Alfred de Quervain[4] following the Second Swiss Expedition in which he crossed the Greenland ice cap from Godhavn (Qeqertarsuaq) on the west, to Sermilik Fjord on the eastern side. De Quervain also identified the position and approximate height of Mont Forel, highest point of Schweizerland. Mont Forel was then thought to be the highest mountain in the Arctic Circle area. However, at the time of the British Arctic Air Route Expedition led by Gino Watkins in 1930, Watkins discovered a new mountain range from the air located over 350 km to the northeast. This was the higher Watkins Range with the Gunnbjørnsfjeld, the actual highest summit in Greenland. An attempt to climb Mont Forel was made by Lawrence Wager and Alfred Stephenson in 1931 but the mountaineers were stopped by the ice dome at the top of the mountain. In the years that followed, Watkins' 1932-33 East Greenland Expedition, the 1934 British Trans-Greenland Expedition with Lindsay, Croft and Lieutenant Arthur Godfrey of the Royal Engineers —which mapped the much larger Crown Prince Frederick Range to the northeast,[8] and the 1936-37 Paul-Émile Victor Expedition visited Schweizerland. All these expeditions carried out surveys in the little-known mountainous region, the latter taking a great number of photographs and sketches.[6] Mont Forel would be finally climbed in the same decade by an expedition of the Akademischer Alpen-Club of Zürich led by André Roch in 1938. The Schweizerland Range is a mountain system bound by the Greenland ice sheet to the north, the northern shore of the Sermilik Fjord system to the south and the Fenris Glacier to the west. Although its eastern limits are not well defined, there are two distinct regions in the range, one located in the south, roughly between the Jura Glacier (Juragletscheren) and the Midgard Glacier, and the other in the north limited by the ice cap at its northern end and the upper reaches of the K.J.V. Steenstrup Glacier to the southeast. The Arctic Circle passes through the southern part of the range. Schweizerland is highly glaciated containing many active glaciers and nunataks and its topography is very pronounced. The highest point of the range is 3383 m high Mont Forel located in the northern region of Schweizerland. Døren is a 1929 m high mountain pass near Mont Forel. The Crown Prince Frederick Range stretches northeastwards to the northeast of Mont Forel. The area of the mountain range is uninhabited but Tasiilaq the most populous community on the eastern coast of Greenland is relatively near. Note: This is just some text from Wikipedia!"

        postTitle: "8 Tips about Fashion Baby!",
        postDate: "4 hour ago",
        postCaption: "Gain confidence in your style with fashion advice for styling every look in your closet. 1. Work your capsule wardrobe. Make sure you have reliable wardrobe staples: an iconic little black dress, a pair of jeans that fit perfectly, a classic blazer, simple T-shirts and button-downs in neutral colors, and an effortless leather jacket (or denim jacket). Investing in a capsule collection of mix-and-match basics (and learning how to style them) is the key to looking put together. 2. Make sure your clothes fit perfectly. One trick to making any item of clothing look amazing is to hire a good tailor. Tailored clothing not only looks polished, but it also feels more comfortable. Pants that drag on the ground and dresses that bunch up awkwardly won't make you feel stylish. If your capsule wardrobe fits you well, you can start to play with over- and under-sized items in a way that feels fashionable, not sloppy. 3. Learn how to balance proportions. Balancing proportions is about styling your outfits to create an overall aesthetic harmony. The way you achieve this is by wearing clothes that are fitted to your body shape. When you want to play with oversized clothes or unusual shapes, make it a fashion moment by keeping the rest of the look fitted. For example, try pairing a tight crop top with wide-leg jeans, or a puff-shoulder top with straight-leg pants. 4. Find your personal style. Developing a signature style can take years, but you can get started by creating a moodboard. Remember that personal style is an experiment; you never know what amazing looks await you until you're in the dressing room. The categories menswear and womenswear shouldn't dictate how you shop. Take time to play with colors and shapes to find what looks great on your unique body. 5. Become a better shopper. Learning how to shop for exactly what you want will help you avoid filling your closet full of items you never wear. When your wardrobe consists of pieces that you love, styling an outfit will become second nature. 6. Add a belt. Adding a belt to your look is one of the easiest ways to make any outfit look more put-together. It's also a great trick for bringing balance to a look that otherwise might not work—like a long cashmere sweater and billowy midi skirt. 7. Play with color. If you're nervous about adding color to your look, start with just one colorful piece, and keep the rest of your look neutral. As you get more comfortable with colors, you'll learn which color combinations work best for your style. Take a look at a color wheel for inspiration. 8. Mix patterns and textures. The days of matching your handbag to your shoes are over. Clashing textures and prints make a bold fashion statement. Start small with neutral patterns like stripes and low-key textures like leather and knits, adding in the sequins and paisleys in small amounts (like a scarf, tie, or clutch) until you learn what works for you."

        postDate: "1 hour ago",
        postCaption: "Top 10 Plant Care Tips. 1.​Choose plants based on your li Are the plants you love the ones you can have? Our #1 rule of (green) thumb is to determine the amount of natural lightyour space receives, and to choose your plant accordingly. If you’re not sure just by looking, start by figuring out which direction your windows face. Generally speaking, south-facing windows give bright light, east & west-facing windows give moderate light, and north-facing windows give low light. If there’s something outside your window—for example, a large tree or building—that could obstruct sunlight, make sure to take that into consideration, too. Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect sunlight, but many can tolerate lower light levels (like low light tolerant snake plants and ZZ plants). If the sun is intense through your windows, you may want to add a sheer curtain to diffuse the light. Cacti and some succulents like aloe can handle brighter, direct sunlight. You don’t want to overexpose or underexpose any plant so keep an eye on them if they're in very bright or very low light. 2.​ Pick plants that work with your schedule New to plant parenthood? A busy ​work schedule, social​ ​life, and general forgetfulness can lead to unintentional plant neglect.It’s okay.Some plants can handle that kind of lifestyle.A jet- setter like yourself will enjoy the resilience of low - maintenance and drought - tolerant succulents, ZZ plants, or snake plants, all pretty low key, as long as they have enough libright and low light respectively.These should keep looking their best when you return from your next trip.If you’ve got more time, you can try a few attention - loving air plants, orchids, or ferns.Like a mist for the face, an extra spritz of filtered water daily between waterings keeps humidity levels nice and balanced for these delicate plants. 3.​ ​Be mindful when watering It’s better to under water your plants than to overwater.Too much water can lead to root rot.Ditch your watering schedule and water your plant only when it needs it.Check the potting mix or soil first to make sure it’s dry at least 2 inches deep below the surface.If your soil looks dark in color, feels moist, and sticks to your finger, your plant has enough water to do it’s thing for now.How often you water will also change throughout the year.Plants need less water in the winter months, when they’re growing slower, the days are shorter and sunlight is less intense.If the heat is on and their soil is drying out quicker, they may need a bit more water.Wilting leaves or soil that looks pulled away from the sides of the planter are signs of a thirsty plant.Always use warm water because it absorbs best.Pour water directly on the soil around the base of the plant, because plants absorb water from their roots.The only exception here is Epiphytes, like air plants, who absorb water through their leaves.You can also place a saucer under your planter, if it has a drainage hole.After you water, let your plant soak up in access water that fills the saucer for a few hours before emptying it. 4.​ ​Raise humidity levels when needed Staying true to your plant's natural environment will help your plant thrive indoors. Most tropical plants prefer high humidity and bright to moderate, indirect light. During the dry months of winter, grouping similar plants together helps to create a more humid microclimate. A humidifier can help too and it’s great for humans (find more ways to increase humidity levels here). On the other hand, most desert dwellers like cacti and succulents prefer dry air and bright, direct light with no shade at all. They don’t much care for humidity. 5.​ ​Always keep temperatures stable Keep​ ​your​ ​plant’s​ ​home environment as stable as possible.Extreme changes can stress plants out.Keep the temperature between 65 and 85 degrees F, and avoid placing your plants near radiators, A / C units, and forced - air vents, which can create hot or cold drafts. 6.​ ​Know when to skip the fertilizer Be mindful when using fertilizer on your houseplants.Too much fertilizer can do more harm than good.Houseplants tend to not need fertilizer as often as outdoor plants do.If you do choose to fertilize your plant, it’s best to do so during the growing season(early spring to early fall) and follow the general rule of thumb: ‘less is more’. Most store - bought fertilizers should be diluted with water before use.If you have had your plant for at least year, you can fertilize it for the first time.We suggest using an all - purpose fertilizer.Always follow the instructions.If you’ve just changed the soil, skip the fertilizer! Fresh soil has enough new nutrients. 7.​ ​Shop from a reliable source Purchase​ ​your ​plants ​from​ ​a​ ​reputable​ ​source like The Sill, your favorite local garden center, and specialty stores or florists.Purchasing from a source with plant experts on site means they can answer all your questions.Most people who sell or work with plants love talking about them.We definitely do.If you're a first time plant parent, avoid large department stores and supermarkets where plants are usually stored in basements or dark warehouses. Check your plant out for yellow leaves, powdery mildew, strange spots, brown tips and weak stems as these are signs of an unhealthy plant. 8.​ Show a little TLC at first Once your plant has been delivered to your door or brought home from your local store, it will need a few weeks to adjust to its new environment.Show your plant a little extra attention in the beginning.Observing your plant will tell you when to water and when to not, if the temperature is too high or too low, and if it’s getting enough sun.Plus they’re so pleasing to look at. 9.​ ​Don’t be scared to repot A common misconception, repotting does not necessarily mean putting your plant in a new planter, but rather, changing out your plant’s soil with fresh potting mix to provide new nutrients.Plants typically need to be repotted every 12 to 18 months, depending on how actively they are growing.If your plant has outgrown its current planter, you can also use this as a time to size up.Choose a planter only 1 to 3 inches larger than its current container.The idea is that your plant is not swimming in soil, which may lead you to overwater, but has a little extra space to grow. 10.​ Keep drainage in mind If you tend to have a heavy hand when watering your plants, keep drainage in mind.You can opt for a planter with a drainage hole and saucer, keep your plant in a grow pot nestled inside a planter, or add lava rocks to the bottom of a planter without a hole(to create crevices for excess water to flow to). Do what works best for you! Don't be afraid to try different methods for different plants."

        postTitle: "21 Useful tips about Makeup",
        postDate: "7 hour ago",
        postCaption: "21 Makeup Tips That will Make Your Life 100 Times Easier ==> whether you're a legit beauty pro or a total newb, you can always benefit from a few makeup tips. Like, why struggle with your cat eye or contour when there are so many easy hacks to make the process 100 times smoother? So in the spirit of sharing is caring, I went ahead and found the 21 best makeup tips and tricks of all damn time, including when (and where) to apply concealer, how to finally perfect your winged eyeliner (spoiler: it involves a spoon), and so much more. So grab your makeup bag and that one product (err, products?) you never learned how to use, and keep scrolling. 1. Apply your foundation before concealer: Hot tip: The easiest way to level up your makeup routine is to try applying your foundation before concealer. Think about it: Starting with a layer of foundation will help minimize any redness or discoloration—almost like you're creating a smooth base for the rest of your products. You can then go in with your concealer to spot treat any zits or remaining redness, and you'll end up using way less product in the process. Another plus? Foundation before concealer is a genius fix for preventing caking and creasing. 2. Maintain your eyebrows with a spoolie brush: On busy days when I don't have time to fill in my eyebrows, I like to do the next best thing: quickly comb up my arches with a spoolie brush (aka those little mascara wands). And even when I do have time for powders, gels, and pencils, I still like to prep my brows with my spoolie—it takes 10 seconds max, and it's an easy way to make sure each of my brow hairs are in the right spot before I go in with my products. Pro makeup tip: You can buy spoolie brushes in bulk for v cheap (I like the Cuttte Disposable Mascara Brushes) or go for something reusable (I'm a fan of Uoma Beauty's Brow-Fro Baby Hair, which also has a precision pencil on one end). 3. Exfoliate your lips before applying lipstick: Okay, you know when you apply lipstick and it doesn't go on smooth? Try prepping your lips with a gentle lip scrub (I like the Beauty Bakerie Sugar Lip Scrub or the KNC Beauty Lip Scrub) —the physical exfoliation will help buff away any dry skin sitting on top of your lips, leaving you with a smoother, softer canvas for your products. One thing to keep in mind: Lip scrubs should only be used once a week max—anything more and you'll risk irritation (aka the opposite vibe you're going for). 4. Don't sleep on blush: It might seem like an obvious step in your makeup routine, but IMO, blush is the most underrated product. A couple sweeps of cream or powder blush along the high points of your cheeks will give your entire look a brighter, warmer finish with pure ease. “I use blush on all my clients—it gives the skin that fresh and rejuvenated look and it adds the perfect amount of depth to the face, makeup artist Lakeisha Dale has told Cosmo. And, no, that doesn't mean you need to pick a bright-pink blush or anything like that—try going for something soft and glowy, like one of the picks below. 5. Melt your pencil liner to help it glide: Fact: Creamy makeup products blend better when they’re warmed up. So if your kohl eyeliner pencil skips or tugs on your eyelid or takes multiple coats for a decent color payoff, melt it down slightly before you start lining. To do so, hold the tip of your kohl liner under the flame of a lighter for a second or until it gets tacky, let it cool slightly (swatch it on your hand to make sure it’s not too hot or melted), then watch the consistency change right before your eyes. 6. Make your eyeshadow pop with white eyeliner: To make a sheer or less pigmented eyeshadow appear more vibrant on your eyelid, blend a white eyeliner pencil over your entire eyelid first. Then, put your eyeshadow right on top. The opaque coverage of the white liner will intensify any eyeshadow shade and make it pop. 7. Outline your cat eye: If you’re struggling with nailing your winged eyeliner look (also, hi, same, I feel you), try drawing the outline of the shape first and then filling it in. Extend a line beyond your lower lash line to create the bottom of your cat eye first. Then, decide on the thickness you want for your wing, and trace the top line from the end point of your flick to your upper lash line. Once you have the shape mapped out on both sides and everything looks symmetrical, fill in the open space. 8. Use a spoon as a stencil for winged liner: If freehand drawing your cat eye just isn’t gonna happen for you, grab a spoon and use it as a stencil. Holding the stem of a spoon against the outer corner of your eye, use a liquid eyeliner to draw a straight line as the first step for your cat eye. Then, flip the spoon so it’s hugging your eyelid, and use the rounded outer edge to create a perfectly curved winged effect. 9. Hack a smoky eye with a hashtag: A smoky eye can go from sultry to sloppy real fast if you don’t know what you’re doing. To keep it simple, use a creamy eyeliner to draw a slanted hashtag symbol on the outer third of your eyelid, then blend it out with the sponge or a smudging brush. This will not only ensure that both eyes are symmetrical, but also prevent you from getting a little too crazy with the eyeliner. 10. Use a spoon as a mascara shield: Nothing is more annoying than making your eyeshadow look perfect, and then swiping on mascara and ruining the whole thing with smudges. The fix? Hold a spoon so it's hugging your eyelid, then apply your mascara like you normally would. As you sweep the mascara wand against your lashes and the back of the spoon, the residue will coat the back of the utensil rather than your skin. Genius. 11. Revive mascara with saline solution: Word of advice: Only use a tube of mascara for three months, max. Beyond that point, it can collect bacteria and lead to eye infections and other unfortunate things you wouldn’t want to search on Google Images. But if your mascara annoyingly dries up within those first three months, add a couple drops of saline solution into the flaky formula to get it back to its smooth consistency. 12. Heat your eyelash curler with a hair dryer: DIY your own heated lash curler by blowing hot air on your eyelash curler. The added heat will help your lashes curl faster and keep the shape for longer. Just hit your lash curler with a blow dryer until it heats up, wait until it cools slightly but is still warm (test it on the inside of your arm so you don’t burn your eyelid), then clamp down on your lashes to curl them. and on and on and on...

        postDate: "10 hour ago",
        postCaption: "Tips for Chilling Out: Why relaxing is so important? There’s no doubt that today’s modern lifestyle can be stressful. Between work, family, and social obligations, it can be hard to make time for yourself. But it’s important to find the time. Relaxing can help keep you healthy, in both your body and mind, helping you recover from the everyday stresses that life throws at you. Luckily, no matter how busy you are, it’s simple to learn how to create time for chilling and also how to best relax. Easy ways to relax: When it comes to relaxation strategies, the easier the better! If you can find five minutes of your day for yourself, you can easily slip in a simple relaxation strategy. Here are some easy ways to help relax: Breathe it out. Breathing exercises are one of the simplest relaxation strategies, and can effectively calm your stressed-out body and mind anywhere at any time. Sit or lay down in a quiet and safe place such as on your bed or the floor in your home and put one of your hands on your belly. Breathe in to a slow count of three, and then breathe out to the same slow count of three. Feel your belly rise and fall as you breathe in and out. Repeat five times, or as long as you need to feel relaxed. Release physical tension. When we feel mentally stressed, we often feel physically stressed as well. Releasing any physical tension can help relieve stress in your body and mind. Lay on a soft surface, such as your bed, a carpet, or a yoga mat. Tense up one part of your body at a time, and then slowly release your muscles. As you do this, notice how your body sensations change. Many people start either with the muscles in their face or those their toes, and then work their way through the muscles across their bodies to the opposite end. Shop for a yoga mat Write down your thoughts. Getting things off your mind by writing them down may help you relax. When you feel stressed, take a few minutes to write down some short notes about how you’re feeling or how your day is going. You might do this in a notebook or in a notes app on your smartphone. Don’t worry about being poetic or spelling everything correctly. Just focus on expressing yourself to help release some of your stress. Shop for a journal Make a list. Making a list about what you’re grateful for can help some people feel relaxed. Experts say that when we’re stressed, we tend to focus on the negative parts of life rather than the positive. Thinking about the positive parts of your life and writing them down may help you chill out. Try to think of three good things that happened to you today and write them down, even if they’re small things like getting to work on time or eating a delicious lunch. Shop for a gratitude book Visualize your calm. Have you ever heard the expression “find your happy place”? Sit in a quiet and safe place, such as your bedroom, and begin to think about a place in the world where you feel most calm. Close your eyes and imagine all the details linked to that place: the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile feelings. For example, if you think of the beach, you might imagine calm waves, the sound of children playing in the sand, the smell of sunscreen, the taste of cool ice cream and the feel of gritty sand under your feet. The more you get into your visualization, the more you can relax. Connect to nature. Spending just a few minutes in nature when you feel stressed may help you relax. When you’re feeling stressed, take a step outside and go for a short walk, or simply sit in nature. But you don’t necessarily need to be in nature to feel its stress-reducing effects. Scientists have found that simply looking at images of natureTrusted Source with greenery for five minutes on a computer screen can help calm you down. So, thanks to technology, even people living and working in big cities far from nature can still experience its calming effects. Shop for nature sounds Relaxation isn’t just for adults: It’s important for kids and teens too. If you sense your child needs to relax, help him or her through these exercises. Better yet, get involved in these easy relaxation exercises with your child. This can help encourage self-regulation and relaxing behavior in your child. Risks of not relaxing enough: Stress is a part of everyday life. It can be a helpful thing that motivates people to act, and can even save your life in a dangerous situation. Most stresses we experience are small, like getting caught in traffic on the way to a party or losing an earring on the train to work. The same helpful “fight-or-flight” instincts we get from these small stressful events in our life can backfire on us if we don’t take time to relax. Relaxation doesn’t just feel good, it’s also important for good health. Stress from work, family, social obligations, and even exercise will wear you out over time if you don’t set aside time to relax. Some of the negative effects of not relaxing enough include: The takeaway: Stress may be a universal part of life, but that doesn’t mean you should let it get the best of you. Take charge and control your stress by learning how to relax. Reach for a simple relaxation exercise when you feel stressed, and encourage your child to do the same if you notice they’re feeling stressed out. Even if you don’t feel very stressed, practicing relaxation exercises daily can be a good preventative measure for keeping stress away in the first place. If relaxation exercises are not helping reduce your stress, you should seek the help of a mental health professional. They’ll be able to recommend a specific treatment plan suited to your needs. Call 911 or the toll-free National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) if you’re having thoughts of suicide."

        postTitle: "Self-Love is everything!",
        postDate: "15 hour ago",
        postCaption: "Here are 13 recipes for self-love that are simple in practice and multifaceted in their benefits ==> 1. Stop comparing yourself to others: We’re socialised to be competitive, so comparing ourselves to others is natural. But it can be dangerous. There’s just no point in comparing yourself to anyone else on the planet because there’s only one you. Rather, focus on yourself and your journey. The shift of energy, alone, will help you feel free. 2. Don’t worry about others’ opinions: In that same vein, don’t worry about what society thinks or expects of you. You can’t make everyone happy, so this is a waste of time and will only slow you down on your journey to being the best you. 3. Allow yourself to make mistakes: We’re told again and again from a young age “nobody’s perfect, everyone makes mistakes.” But the older you get, the more pressure you feel never to fail. Cut yourself some slack! Make mistakes so you can learn and grow from them. Embrace your past. You’re constantly changing and growing from who you once were into who you are today and who you will be one day. So, forget about that voice in your head that says you need to be perfect. Make mistakes — lots of them! The lessons you’ll gain are priceless. 4. Remember your value doesn’t lie in how your body looks: This is fundamental! So many things in the world want to distract you from this powerful truth. Sometimes even your own internalized sexism affirms your thoughts of inadequacy. You are valuable because you are you, not because of your body. So, wear what makes you feel good. If it’s a lot or if it’s a little, wear what makes you feel confident, comfortable, and happy. 5. Don’t be afraid to let go of toxic people: Not everybody takes responsibility for the energy they put out into the world. If there’s someone who is bringing toxicity into your life and they won’t take responsibility for it, that might mean you need to step away from them. Don’t be afraid to do this. It’s liberating and important, even though it may be painful. Remember: Protect your energy. It’s not rude or wrong to remove yourself from situations or the company of people who are draining you. 6. Process your fears: Like erring, feeling afraid is natural and human. Don’t reject your fears — understand them. This healthy exercise can really help with your mental health. Interrogating and evaluating your fears helps you to gain clarity and unmask issues in your life that were causing you anxiety. That, in turn, can help alleviate some — if not all — of your anxiety. 7. Trust yourself to make good decisions for yourself: We so often doubt ourselves and our ability to do what’s right, when most of the time we do know in our hearts what’s best. Remember that your feelings are valid. You’re not losing touch with reality. You know yourself better than anyone else, so be your best advocate. 8. Take every opportunity life presents or create your own: "
